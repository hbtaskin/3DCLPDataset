# Introduction

These datasets were used [in a study](#citation) of a 3D container loading problem with heuristic solutions. In this study, the problem of loading three-dimensional products into containers, arranging them in the container according to the customer order and routing the container is considered.

## Input Data

- boxes5-1.txt ... boxes50-3.txt files in the repository contain the product sizes, weights and customer numbers to be loaded into containers.
- conts-1.txt and conts-2.txt files contain the dimensions of the containers in which the product will be loaded, the maximum tonnage value and the first axle and last axle values to ensure balanced weight distribution.

>[!NOTE]
>Values are recorded in **mm**.

### Meaning of file names
- For example for the file boxes**10**-**1**.txt;
  - **10**: Represents the number of boxes.
  - **1**: Represents the number of customers.
- For example the conts-1.txt and conts-2.txt file;
  - Refers to two different types of containers.
